## Our Goal: 
Our central goal is to help you achieve your fitness goal. By recommending customized workouts and tracking incremental progress (PRs, weights used, etc.), we accompany you on your journey from start to finish. Unlike other websites and apps, we go the extra mile and build a supportive community where you can post about your workouts, celebrate your progress, and cheer on your buddies in their journey. With GymBuddies, you will never have to workout alone.

## What we offer:
Begin by using our create workout page to search for workout routines relating to the body part you wish to workout. This will display a picture and set of instructions to perform for each workout. Once you complete each workout, use our logging system to log the weights and number of reps and sets you performed. Finally, you can post your progress to our blog/social platform. Our blogging platform sets us apart from other fitness platforms and apps. GymBuddies allows users to post and view the progress of similar fitness enthusiasts. Use our create post feature to post and edit your personal blogs for other users to see and comment on.
